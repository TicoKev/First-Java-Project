# First-Java-Project
Hi, so this is my first Java project. The variables are in Spanish. I created this last year around December. As you can see, it's a very basic code, as this was only my first university project and there's still a long way ahead of me. This is a basic 'gaming system'
 in which you can buy PCs, consoles and accesories.
